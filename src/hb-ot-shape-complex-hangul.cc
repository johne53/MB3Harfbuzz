  /* Hangul syllables come in two shapes: LV, and LVT.  Of those:
   *
   *   - LV can be precomposed, or decomposed.  Lets call those
   *     <LV> and <L,V>,
   *   - LVT can be fully precomposed, partically precomposed, or
   *     fully decomposed.  Ie. <LVT>, <LV,T>, or <L,V,T>.
   *
   * The composition / decomposition is mechanical.  However, not
   * all <L,V> sequences compose, and not all <LV,T> sequences
   * compose.
   *
   * Here are the specifics:
   *
   *   - <L>: U+1100..115F, U+A960..A97F
   *   - <V>: U+1160..11A7, U+D7B0..D7C7
   *   - <T>: U+11A8..11FF, U+D7CB..D7FB
   *
   *   - Only the <L,V> sequences for the 11xx ranges combine.
   *   - Only <LV,T> sequences for T in U+11A8..11C3 combine.
   *
   * Here is what we want to accomplish in this shaper:
   *
   *   - If the whole syllable can be precomposed, do that,
   *   - Otherwise, fully decompose.
   *
   * That is, of the different possible syllables:
   *
   *   <L>
   *   <L,V>
   *   <L,V,T>
   *   <LV>
   *   <LVT>
   *   <LV, T>
   *
   * - <L> needs no work.
   *
   * - <LV> and <LVT> can stay the way they are if the font supports them, otherwise we
   *   should fully decompose them if font supports.
   *
   * - <L,V> and <L,V,T> we should compose if the whole thing can be composed.
   *
   * - <LV,T> we should compose if the whole thing can be composed, otherwise we should
   *   decompose.
